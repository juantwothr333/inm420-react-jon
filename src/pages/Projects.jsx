            <p>
            They’re friendly, easygoing, and love to hang out with humans. Capybaras are also a lot 
            bigger than most rodents (they can grow up to be three feet long), which is why they’re sometimes 
            called giant rats or giant guinea pigs. These guys have been around forever—over three million years!—but 
            if you’ve never seen one before, then let me be your guide in the world of capybara cuteness.

            <h2>CAPY'S ARE THE BEST RODENT</h2>
            <p>Capybaras are the kind of animal who will let you pet them, even if it’s your first time meeting them. 
              They don’t care if there’s a snake nearby or if their friends are nearby; they’re just happy to 
              hang out with anyone and everyone. This makes them pretty popular as pets because they aren’t afraid of anything!</p>
            <p>Capybaras are very social animals and love to play with each other and humans. In fact, they’re so friendly that they sometimes 
              cuddle up to their owners in bed at night. They often enjoy playing with toys, especially balls and stuffed animals. Capybaras also love water; 
              this makes them the perfect pet for people who live near lakes or rivers because their owners can take them swimming anytime!</p>
